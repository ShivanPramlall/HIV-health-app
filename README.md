A comprehensive HIV Management System for healthcare professionals. This powerful system offers user-friendly profile management, robust patient records, easy data updates, real-time health status reports, and gene mutation detection. To improve patient care, the system provides tailored treatment recommendations based on CD4 count and viral load, marking a significant advancement in healthcare technology.

HIV. drug resistance is a significant challenge in RSA, where a large population is affected by the virus and antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a common treatment. As HIV can mutate and become resistant to certain drugs, monitoring, and managing drug resistance is crucial for effective treatment.

I created two Finite State Machines using Transitions library in Python to:
o	Search for specific genetic patterns that may indicate the presence of HIV in a biological sequence.
o	Scan biological sequences to find mutations and generate a report.
